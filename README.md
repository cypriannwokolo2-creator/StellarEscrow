# StellarEscrow

Production-ready Soroban smart contract for peer-to-peer marketplace escrow on Stellar blockchain, with a comprehensive event indexing service.

## Overview

StellarEscrow is a decentralized escrow system that enables secure peer-to-peer trades using USDC stablecoin. The platform connects buyers and sellers with optional arbitrators who can resolve disputes, with the smart contract managing escrow, fee collection, and settlement.

The project includes:
- **Smart Contract**: Soroban contract written in Rust
- **Event Indexer**: High-performance indexing service for real-time event monitoring and querying

## Features

- **Escrow-Based Trading**: Secure USDC deposits held in contract until trade completion
- **Arbitrator Network**: Registered arbitrators handle dispute resolution
- **Automated Fee Collection**: Platform fees calculated and accumulated automatically
- **Multi-Status Tracking**: Trades tracked through Created, Funded, Completed, Disputed, and Cancelled states
- **Authorization Security**: Role-based access control for all operations
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging for off-chain monitoring
- **Dispute Resolution**: Arbitrators can release funds to buyer or seller
- **Cancellation Support**: Sellers can cancel unfunded trades
- **Admin Controls**: Platform fee management and fee withdrawal capabilities
- **Event Indexing**: Real-time event monitoring, storage, and querying
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Live event updates for connected clients
- **REST API**: Efficient event querying and replay functionality

## Architecture

### Smart Contract (`contract/`)

**Core Components**
- `lib.rs`: Main contract implementation with all public functions
- `types.rs`: Data structures (Trade, TradeStatus, DisputeResolution)
- `storage.rs`: Persistent and instance storage management
- `errors.rs`: Custom error types for contract operations
- `events.rs`: Event emission functions for monitoring

### Event Indexer (`indexer/`)

**Core Components**
- `main.rs`: Service entry point and server setup
- `config.rs`: Configuration management
- `database.rs`: PostgreSQL database operations
- `event_monitor.rs`: Stellar network event monitoring
- `handlers.rs`: REST API endpoint handlers
- `websocket.rs`: WebSocket connection management
- `models.rs`: Data structures and types
- `error.rs`: Error handling

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Soroban CLI (for contract deployment)
- Stellar account with XLM for fees

### 1. Build the Contract

```bash
cd contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### 2. Deploy the Contract

```bash
# Using Soroban CLI
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_escrow_contract.wasm \
  --source <your-secret-key> \
  --network testnet
```

### 3. Setup the Indexer

```bash
cd indexer

# Install sqlx CLI
cargo install sqlx-cli

# Setup database
createdb stellar_escrow
sqlx migrate run

# Configure
cp config.toml config.local.toml
# Edit config.local.toml with your contract ID and database URL
```

### 4. Run the Indexer

```bash
cargo run -- --config config.local.toml
```

## Contract Functions

### Administrative Functions
- `initialize(admin, usdc_token, fee_bps)` - One-time contract initialization
- `register_arbitrator(arbitrator)` - Add arbitrator to approved list (admin only)
- `remove_arbitrator_fn(arbitrator)` - Remove arbitrator from approved list (admin only)
- `update_fee(fee_bps)` - Update platform fee percentage (admin only)
- `withdraw_fees(to)` - Withdraw accumulated fees (admin only)

### User Functions
- `create_trade(seller, buyer, amount, arbitrator)` - Create new trade (seller auth required)
- `fund_trade(trade_id)` - Buyer funds the escrow (buyer auth required)
- `complete_trade(trade_id)` - Seller confirms delivery (seller auth required)
- `confirm_receipt(trade_id)` - Buyer confirms receipt and releases funds (buyer auth required)
- `raise_dispute(trade_id)` - Either party raises dispute (buyer/seller auth required)

## Indexer API

### REST Endpoints

#### Health Check
```
GET /health
```

#### Get Events
```
GET /events?limit=50&event_type=trade_created&trade_id=123
```

#### Get Event by ID
```
GET /events/{uuid}
```

#### Get Events by Trade ID
```
GET /events/trade/{trade_id}
```

#### Replay Events
```
POST /events/replay
{
  "from_ledger": 123456,
  "to_ledger": 123500
}
```

### WebSocket Streaming

Connect to `/ws` for real-time event updates:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('New event:', data);
};
```

## Security Features

- **Authorization Checks**: All state-changing operations require proper authorization
- **Status Validation**: Prevents invalid state transitions
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations with overflow checks
- **Arbitrator Verification**: Only registered arbitrators can resolve disputes
- **Ownership Validation**: Only trade parties can perform specific actions

## Testing

### Contract Tests

```bash
cd contract
cargo test
```

### Indexer Tests

```bash
cd indexer
cargo test
```

The contract includes comprehensive tests covering:
✅ Initialization and configuration
✅ Arbitrator registration and removal
✅ Fee updates and validation
✅ Trade creation and funding
✅ Trade completion flow
✅ Dispute raising and resolution
✅ Cancellation logic
✅ Fee withdrawal by admin
✅ Authorization enforcement
✅ Error conditions
✅ Event emission verification
✅ Multiple trades handling
✅ Fee calculation accuracy

## Deployment

### Contract Deployment

1. Build optimized WASM:
```bash
cd contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

2. Deploy using Soroban CLI or your preferred deployment tool

### Indexer Deployment

1. Build release binary:
```bash
cd indexer
cargo build --release
```

2. Configure production settings in `config.toml`
3. Run migrations on production database
4. Start the service

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Contract

soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_escrow.wasm
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet

  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_escrow.optimized.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### 3. Initialize

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --usdc_token <USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --fee_bps 100
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

## Usage Flow

### Admin Setup
1. Deploy contract
2. Initialize with admin address, USDC token, and fee percentage
3. Register trusted arbitrators

### Create Trade
1. Seller creates trade with buyer address, amount, and optional arbitrator
2. Trade ID returned for tracking

### Fund Trade
1. Buyer approves USDC transfer to contract
2. Buyer calls `fund_trade` with trade ID
3. Contract transfers USDC from buyer to escrow

### Complete Trade (Happy Path)
1. Seller delivers goods/services off-chain
2. Seller calls `complete_trade`
3. Buyer calls `confirm_receipt`
4. Contract transfers USDC minus fee to seller
5. Fee added to accumulated platform fees

### Dispute Resolution
1. Either party calls `raise_dispute`
2. Arbitrator investigates off-chain
3. Arbitrator calls `resolve_dispute` with resolution (ReleaseToBuyer or ReleaseToSeller)
4. Contract transfers funds accordingly minus arbitration fee

### Fee Management
1. Admin monitors accumulated fees
2. Admin calls `withdraw_fees` to collect platform revenue

## Error Codes

| Code | Error | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | AlreadyInitialized | Contract already initialized |
| 2 | NotInitialized | Contract not initialized |
| 3 | InvalidAmount | Amount must be greater than 0 |
| 4 | InvalidFeeBps | Fee must be between 0-10000 bps |
| 5 | ArbitratorNotRegistered | Arbitrator not in approved list |
| 6 | TradeNotFound | Trade ID does not exist |
| 7 | InvalidStatus | Operation not allowed in current status |
| 8 | Overflow | Arithmetic overflow detected |
| 9 | NoFeesToWithdraw | No accumulated fees available |
| 10 | Unauthorized | Caller not authorized for this operation |

## Events

- `created` - New trade created
- `funded` - Buyer funded escrow
- `complete` - Seller marked as delivered
- `confirm` - Buyer confirmed receipt and settled
- `dispute` - Dispute initiated
- `resolved` - Arbitrator resolved dispute
- `cancel` - Trade cancelled
- `arb_reg` - Arbitrator registered
- `arb_rem` - Arbitrator removed
- `fee_upd` - Platform fee updated
- `fees_out` - Fees withdrawn by admin
